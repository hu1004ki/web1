<p>
  Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn HTML
  and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This is
  because HTML is far more interesting and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS,
  and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.
  Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar
  with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content).
  You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software and understand
  how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files â€” both of which are parts of our
  Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.
